        Travis Scott has always sounded like an amalgamation of other artists,
        prominently borrowing flows and cadences from mentor Kanye West as well
        as the likes of Future, Kid Cudi, and The Weeknd. To be frank, his music
        - to date - has been lacking in a singular vision, with Scott only
        showing flashes of brilliance and unable to craft a consistently
        engaging LP. Having a child with Kylie Jenner, one of the most famous
        celebrities on the planet, has only added to fears that the Texas-based
        artist is more committed to the idea of acting like a rock star than
        actually sounding like one. Thankfully, his brilliant third studio
        album, Astroworld, more than addresses these concerns; it is here that
        Travis Scott finally lives up to his potential. Named after a theme park
        in Houston that closed in the late nineties, Astroworld has been crafted
        with the kind of focus and love sorely missing from the disjointed
        studio efforts Rodeo and Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight. “They tore
        down AstroWorld to build more apartment space,” Scott told GQ Style. “We
        want it back. We want the building back. That’s why I’m doing [this
        album].” And just like a rollercoaster at the now defunct theme park,
        Astroworld is filled with unexpected twists and turns. The way this
        music seamlessly shifts from trap anthems (the killer 21 Savage verse on
        "NC-17") to autotune-driven psychedelia (the almost alien-like synths of
        "Astrothunder") is genuinely thrilling to listen to. Do you remember the
        first time you heard the beat switch on Frank Ocean’s "Nights"? That
        feeling like your brain had just elevated beyond the stars? Well,
        Astroworld does this on at least five occasions. On album opener
        "Stargazing," Scott lulls the listener into a false state of dreamy
        euphoria, before the beat evaporates into the chaos of a mosh pit. When
        Scott confidently raps “This right here is astronomical,” it doesn’t
        sound like a boast, but a fact. There’s similar disruption evident on
        "Sicko Mode," which goes from Scott spitting jokey bars (“I might take
        all my exes and put them in a group!”) amid "No Limit"-era drums to
        guest star Drake flowing triumphantly over eerie keys that sound like
        they’ve been lifted straight from a John Carpenter horror film. These
        transitions feel a lot like going through the different rooms of a
        haunted house ride, with Scott always looking to outdo the last surprise
        and create an even louder scream from his audience. The structure of
        these songs splits off into pieces before being violently welded back
        together again – a move that feels not only inspired by Frank Ocean’s
        Blonde but also 1960s conceptual rock, particularly capricious songs
        such as The Beatles’ "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" and Love’s "The Red
        Telephone." When it comes to features, there’s an embarrassment of
        riches being offered on Astroworld, with Scott often taking a backseat
        as he curates an atmosphere that matches the spontaneity of the
        different worlds at an amusement park. Frank Ocean’s soothing hook on
        "Carousel" and the heavenly guitar licks of Kevin Parker (who shows up
        on "Skeletons," which sounds like the spiritual successor to his band
        Tame Impala’s classic "Feels Like We Only Go Backwards") are among the
        highlights. Yet nothing comes close to matching the sheer transcendence
        of hearing Kid Cudi’s haunting humming over the top of Stevie Wonder’s
        gorgeous harmonica playing on "Stop Trying To Be God." By the time James
        Blake turns up to delicately sing one of his trademark introspective
        sermons, this track’s beauty will start to overwhelm you – it’s easily
        one of the best songs of 2018. In many ways, Scott’s greatest talent is
        in knowing when to step into the background and give someone else a go.
        Every feature on Astroworld feels like a chess move rather than an
        over-indulgence. You could argue that the subject matter of Astroworld
        doesn’t stretch too far beyond problematic references to Xanax and silly
        punch lines about Stacey Dash, money, and easy sex (“She keeps an open
        mouth and an open mind” is among the most cringeworthy of Scott’s latest
        lyrics). However, Scott’s delicate vocal delivery makes these brags go a
        lot further than the average rapper — he delivers them on a double edged
        sword: vulnerability and melancholy threaten to tip over into sarcasm.
        It’s as if Astroworld is a look inside the mind of an artist who is
        happy to indulge in the excesses of fame, but having an existential
        crisis while doing so – a dilemma perfectly summarized in the tone of
        mournful highlight "Can’t Say." That’s not to say Scott’s verses are
        devoid of depth. The guitar-driven "Coffee Bean" is the greatest example
        of his growth lyrically, with Scott powerfully rapping about the racial
        struggles of being black and dating a Kardashian (“Your family told you
        I’m a bad move plus I’m already a black dude!") in a way Kanye West
        attempted yet failed to do on ye’s introspective cut "Wouldn’t Leave."
        The song’s strings, which carry a tinge of sadness, are also a beautiful
        touch. If you were to level any criticism at Astroworld, it would be
        that this kind of emotional clarity doesn’t occur more frequently.
        There’s a druggy swirl to Astroworld, with the music’s many transitions
        feeling hallucinatory in nature. It's a record that sounds like lucid
        dreaming via balling out at the strip club with Migos and 21 Savage.
        "Who? What!" and its many waves of electrical bass recall the beginning
        stages of an acid trip, while the gorgeous howls at the end of "5% Tint"
        are more Sufjan Stevens than Quavo. Perhaps none of this would be
        possible without A$AP Rocky’s 2015 sophomore At.Long.Last.A$AP, an LP
        that wrote the script for the psychedelic experimentation U.S. rappers
        have been letting inspire their music over the past few years. But even
        if A$AP’s album remains criminally underrated, Astroworld contains
        better music, never losing its ability to entertain or surprise. Maximum
        credit should also be given to veteran executive producer Mike Dean, who
        ensures this album breaks new ground sonically while still paying homage
        to Scott’s Texan roots via the trippy basslines of DJ Screw and a spoken
        word monologue by local legend Big Tuck. Astroworld will be remembered
        as the moment Travis Scott produced a piece of music worthy of the riots
        he is capable of inducing. It’s a wildly entertaining circus ride, the
        unpredictable concept album of apocalyptic partying that Gorillaz
        threatened to make with last year’s Humanz, but ultimately failed to
        deliver. Travis Scott desperately needed a great album to justify the
        hype, and with Astroworld, he just might have a classic.
