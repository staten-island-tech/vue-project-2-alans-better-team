        After over a year and a half of hype, Playboi Carti’s highly anticipated
        second album Whole Lotta Red was released last year on December 25th.
        Coming in with a whopping 24 songs, the album was either the best
        Christmas gift for some fans or a heaping pile of coal for others. The
        overall response towards the album was divided, you had those who
        appreciated this new, “punk” aesthetic and abrasive sound, and others
        who despised it, calling the album lazy and messy. I too didn’t know
        what to think of WLR for the past eight months. Part of me was iffy
        about the whole thing, yet I found myself going back and listening to
        the album every so often. It wasn’t until recently while watching
        Carti’s Lollapalooza performance that I decided to give WLR another
        listen, and oddly enough I finally have my own verdict. Whole Lotta Red
        is by no means an amazing album, nor is it a bad album either. At its
        best, Carti matches the psyched-out beats with his melodic and new
        hard-hitting punk side. At its worst, Whole Lotta Red is filled with so
        many throwaway tracks that could have been left on the cutting room
        floor, that sour the overall experience. What we get is an album that is
        equal parts good, and mediocre. The production for WLR was a surprise,
        primarily because of the lack of Pi’erre Bourne beats. The producer who
        helped hone in Carti’s sound on breakout tracks like “Magnolia”,
        “Wokeuplikethis” and “R.I.P.” Is almost nowhere to be found, save for
        only two songs “Place” and “ILoveUIHateU”. The majority of WLR’s
        production is handled by F1lthy, Art Dealer, Star Boy, and Maaly Raw
        among others. They provide Carti with some of the glitchiest, frenetic
        beats he’s ever rapped on. Songs like the blaring opener “Rockstar
        Made”, the chaotic bass of “Stop Breathing”, “Die4Guy” and “New Tank” or
        the ear-splitting “OnThatTime” all fit into this new punk trap aesthetic
        Carti’s going for on WLR. When Carti finds that balance between punk and
        trap is when WLR shines, and these aforementioned songs exemplify that.
        Unfortunately, it gets a little too much to handle, as oftentimes the
        production would leave me feeling confused. As is the case with the song
        “Control”, there are these weird EDM synths and drum beats that remind
        me too much of that weird stage in the 2010s when all music tried to be
        dubstep. “Vamp Anthem” samples Bach’s “Toccata and Fugue in D minor”
        (literally Dracula’s theme song) and makes for one of the strangest
        instrumentals I’ve ever heard. There are a lot of ideas and experiments
        that Carti wanted to try here, but they either majorly hit or miss the
        target. A majority of the album became quite forgettable for me.
        Particularly towards the middle and latter half of the album. I’d feel
        I’m either being beaten or bored to death with some of these beats. WLR
        does bring Carti back into that cloud rap, melodic vibe that he became
        popular for on songs like “Sky”, “Place”, “New N3on” and “Over”. All of
        which have this airy, psychedelic tone to them, and Carti manages to
        ride these beats like it's nothing. These tracks are quite honestly the
        highlight of the album and If WLR had sounded like these four songs for
        the whole album I would’ve been content. The experimentation with more
        abrasive sounds as I said before does work sometimes, but WLR’s
        insistence on this punk-trap aesthetic hinders it from what makes
        Carti’s music (to me at least) shine as it did on Die Lit. When it comes
        to lyrics, don’t expect Carti to drop some heavy bars, in case you
        weren’t aware that’s not his thing. Like most other rappers in the
        “mumble rap” genre, Carti focuses more so on melodies than bars, so
        expect a ton of repetition on hooks and verses. Carti does away with the
        “baby voice” that he became known for, he sounds more raspy and angry
        most of the time. The lyrics here seemingly match each song’s tone. On
        the heavier, abrasive tracks. Carti’s bold and questionably violent, as
        he tells listeners on the hook of “No Sl33p” (“when I go to sleep I
        dream ‘bout murder.”). Whereas on songs like “Sky”, Carti’s euphoric and
        drug-riddled (“I’m tryin’ to get high ‘till I can’t feel nothin’. I
        could fall out the sky and I still won’t feel nothin’.”). Then you have
        these truth bombs being dropped like Carti was trying to go deep but in
        execution, it’s just odd. Such as the second verse on “Punk Monk” where
        Carti reveals how he was trying to get Trippie Redd signed to a major
        label, problems with Pi’erre, etc. It’s like why? Carti spent up until
        this point in the album with this new punk vibe, he’s moshing and
        partying and now he suddenly wants to get insightful? Even the
        aforementioned “Control” is a strange attempt at a love song, where
        Carti says he’s not a stalker but spends the majority of the song
        creepily pleading with his girl or ex-girl like a stalker. There are
        guest features here as well, a matter of fact some of the best songs on
        WLR are the ones with guests. Kanye West comes through on the
        Yeezus-like “Go2DaMoon” where he spits one of his best lines in a long
        time. (“Everybody wear a costume, spray a little extra perfume YEEZYs in
        the stock room, that’s the name, make the stock boom.”). Kid Cudi chimes
        in on “M3tamorphosis”, both rappers are in a state of pure zen where
        they feel nobody can tell them anything, Cudi’s hums and the song’s
        booming bass match up perfectly. Future spins by on “Teen X”, where both
        he and Carti splurge on their drug habits of lean and ecstasy, with
        Carti bringing back the baby voice for old times sake. Overall, Whole
        Lotta Red is a mixed bag. It’s evident Carti wanted to experiment with
        his sound and take his music to another realm. When it works, it
        certainly does, but when it fumbles it fumbles badly. For every good
        song I mentioned, there’s an equally bad one. Supposedly there may be a
        deluxe version of Whole Lotta Red coming out at some point so that could
        maybe fix the album’s shortcomings? but that’s still up in the air. As a
        final rating, I’m giving Whole Lotta Red a 5/10. There are a handful of
        good songs here, most of which are great to vibe to and capture Playboi
        Carti’s spirit. However, there are a lot of questionable and weirdly
        produced tracks that are mediocre and forgettable, which really bog the
        whole album down. I do still think it’s worth a listen if you haven’t
        heard WLR yet, maybe there’s something there that you might like that I
        criticized, or you might feel the same way I did. Favourite Tracks:
        Rockstar Made, Go2DaMoon, Stop Breathing, M3tamorphosis, Teen X, New
        N3on, Over, Sky, Die4Guy.
